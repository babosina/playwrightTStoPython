# PHASE 1 - Create a Plan
Follow the instructions in the following document (Instructions.md).
You don't need to execute the code, but rather create a plan that will be used later as a baseline for the actual tests.

# PHASE 2 - Understand the Plan
Follow the plan described in the ExecutionPlan.md and create a folder structure for the future tests.
You should create it inside the ./ai_powered folder. No other folders should be touched.

# PHASE 3 - Parse the API spec and create the tests
Parse the API specification in the ./ai_powered/conduit_localhost.yaml file.
Add the actual tests for the auth, articles and tags in the corresponding files.

# PHASE 4 - Generate UI tests
Use Playwright MCP to do the following for URL: http://localhost:4200/#/
1. Discover key pages and components (nav, login, sigh up, articles, etc).
2. Produce a test plan with ~6 test cases (title, intent, preconditions, steps, assertions). Save it in ./ai_powered/ui_tests folder under the name UITestsPlan.md.
3. Ask me 3-5 clarification questions ONLY if required.
4. Then generate pytest Playwright tests in the ./ai_powered/ui_tests folder.
5. Use robust locators (get_by_role / get_by_label / get_by_placeholder) and avoid brittle CSS/XPath.
6. Add screenshots on failure and keep tests independent.

Test Case example:
1. Navigate to the home page.
2. Make assertion that the home page is loaded.
3. Navigate to the Sign up page (/register).
4. Enter some valid test data.
5. Assert the account is created successfully.

Test Case example 2:
1. Navigate to the home page.
2. Make assertion that the home page is loaded.
3. Chose any article and try to like it.
4. Assert the redirect to the Sign in page for the unauthorized in user.
