# PHASE 1 - Create a Plan
Follow the instructions in the following document (Instructions.md).
You don't need to execute the code, but rather create a plan that will be used later as a baseline for the actual tests.

# PHASE 2 - Understand the Plan
Follow the plan described in the ExecutionPlan.md and create a folder structure for the future tests.
You should create it inside the ./ai-powered folder. No other folders should be touched.

# PHASE 3 - Parse the API spec and create the tests
Parse the API specification in the ./ai-powered/conduit_localhost.yaml file.
Add the actual tests for the auth, articles and tags in the corresponding files.
